# Heart_Failure_Prediction_Project
This project involves prediction of heart failure using 11 features which are:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- `Age`: age of the patient [years]
-`Sex`: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
-`ChestPainType`: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
-`RestingBP`: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
-`Cholesterol`: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
-`FastingBS`: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
-`RestingECG`: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST ---   elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), 
- `LVH`: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
-`MaxHR`: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
-`ExerciseAngina`: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
-`Oldpeak`: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
-`ST_Slope`: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
-`HeartDisease`: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

# Algorithm used for classification the heart failure prediction
# 1)Logistic regression

# 2)RandomForestClassifier



# Sample Datasets given to test both model
